			<p> Living in a Brooklyn apartment may have been a dream once upon a time for many but in the last year has turned into a bit of a nightmare. With much of life moving indoors- work, school, virtual social gatherings- NYC’s stacked residences have been creating more noise than usual lately, and folks are complaining. </p>

			<p> At the start of the pandemic lockdown, in March of 2020, the noise complaints begin to noticeably increase compared to previous years. March of the previous 3 years saw noise complaints in the 4000 count. However, in March of 2020, complaints jumped to the 6000s. By the time the weather got warmer, in May of 2020, we see a dramatic increase in complaints, jumping to over 10,000, a number that hadn’t been hit for any month in the previous 3 years. </p>


			<p> “More people staying home means they are more likely to be annoyed” says Jerome Krase, professor of Sociology at Brooklyn College. “There’s a psychological issue too. People are more likely to complain when they’re confined.”</p>
